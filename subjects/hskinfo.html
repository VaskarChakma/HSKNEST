        <h1>Explanation about HSK </h1>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2><u>What is HSK</u></h2>
            <p>The <strong>Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi</strong> (HSK; Chinese: 汉语水平考试; pinyin: Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì),
                translated as the
                Chinese Proficiency Test, is the standardized test of Standard Chinese (a type of Mandarin Chinese)
                language proficiency of Mainland China for non-native speakers such as foreign students and overseas
                Chinese. The test is administered by Hanban, an agency of the Ministry of Education of the People's
                Republic of China.The HSK test measures your ability to use and understand the Chinese language as it’s
                read, written, heard and spoken with Chinese people. It`s the most accepted Chinese language test in the
                world.

                </center><br>

                In order for the HSK test to measure how well you read, listen, speak and write in Chinese, and how well
                you use these skills together, you’ll be asked to integrate these skills for the test. For example, you
                may read a passage or listen to a dialogue, and to write about what you learned. The HSK test measures
                your ability to integrate the four Chinese skills you need in an Chinese related setting.

                HSK test is held regularly in China and other countries each year. Certificates of HSK will be issued to
                those who have secured the required scores.

            </p>
            <h2><u>History & Background of HSK</u> </h2>
            <p>Development of the HSK test began in 1984 at Beijing Language and Culture University, and was officially
                made a national standardized test in 1992. By 2005, over 120 countries had participated as regular host
                sites and the tests had been taken around 100 million times (domestic ethnic minority candidates
                included). In 2011, Beijing International Chinese College became the first HSK testing center to
                conduct the HSK test online.
                <center>
                    <img src="../images/extra/hskcertificate.jpg"><br>
                    <h5>(HSK Sample Certificate)</h5>
                </center><br>

                The HSK test is analogous to the English TOEFL, and an HSK certificate is valid without any limitation
                in China. The test aims to be a certificate of language proficiency for higher educational and
                professional purposes. It is not uncommon to refer to a standard or level of proficiency by the HSK
                level number, or score. For example, a job description might ask for foreign applicants with "HSK5 or
                better."

            <h2><u>Test Levels (Between 2010 - 2021)</u></h2>
            <p> Most notable are the inclusion of written segments at all levels (not just in the Advanced levels as in
                the pre-2010 test), a reform of the ranking system, and the use of new question structures. Complete
                vocabulary lists, previous tests, and simulated tests are available as preparation materials. A minor
                update of the vocabulary lists was made in 2012.

                The HSK consists of a written test and an oral test, which are taken separately. This oral test is also
                known as the HSKK or Chinese: 汉语水平口语考试; pinyin: <i> Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǒuyǔ Kǎoshì.</i>

                The Listening, Reading and Writing tests each have a maximum score of 100. HSK 1 and 2 therefore have a
                maximum score of 200 with 120 points required to pass. HSK 3 and 4 have a maximum of 300 points
                with 180 points required to pass. There is no minimum number of points required for each of the
                sections as long as the sum is over 120 or 180 points respectively.

                HSK 5 and 6 also have a maximum of 300 points and originally required a score of 180 points to
                pass. However, since a decision made in February 2013, there has been no official passing score
                for either HSK 5 or 6.

                Hanban provides examples of the exam for the different levels together with a list of words that need to
                be known for each level. These examples are also available (together with the audio for the
                Listening Test) on the websites of the Confucius Institute at QUT and HSK Academy.

            <p>
            <h3>Online Test</h3> <br>
            The written version is now available in two forms, a computer and a paper based test. Both tests are still
            held at test centers, the differences between the two are as follows:
            <br>
            <blockquote>--> Not every test center has the facilities for conducting computer-based tests <br>
                --> Computer-based tests allow you to input characters using the keyboard <br>
                --> Results of computer-based tests are published two weeks after the exam, paper-based test results
                take one
                month </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Oral Test</h3> <br>
            The HSKK test is a separate test. However, the three HSKK levels correspond with the six HSK levels of the
            written test.

            <p>Non-native speakers (foreigners, overseas Chinese and students of Chinese national minorities).</p>

            <h2><u>Why Take HSK Test</u></h2>
            <p>The new HSK test retains the former HSK’s orientation as a general (or universal) Chinese language
                abilities test for adult learners. The results of the HSK test can serve several purposes:<br>

                <br>1. A reference for an educational institution’s decision-making concerning recruiting students,
                assigning students to different classes, allowing students to skip certain courses and granting students
                academic credits.

                <br>2. A reference for employers’ decision-making concerning the recruitment, training and promotion of
                test
                takers.

                <br>3. A method for Chinese language learners to assess and improve their proficiency in Chinese.

                <br>4. A method for Chinese language training institutions to evaluate training results.
            </p>

            <h2><u>HSK Organizer and Certificate Issuer</u></h2>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Education has established China National Committee for Chinese Proficiency Test
                (HSK)(CNCCPT). The Committee is the supervisor of HSK and the issuer of the Chinese proficiency
                certificates. CNCCPT has an office called Office of China National Committee for Chinese Proficiency
                Test (HSK), which takes care of the HSK affairs together with the HSK Center of BLCU.

                Test takers who are able to pass the HSK (Level VI) can easily comprehend written and spoken information
                in Chinese and can effectively express themselves in Chinese, both orally and on paper.</p>

            <h2><u>New Changes in China about HSK</u></h2>
            <p>From Jan 2023, if you take the HSK （Chinese Proficiency Test）test in China (including the mainland, Hong
                Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), the HSKK (Chinese Proficiency Speaking Test) has to be completed at the same
                time. For the following HSK levels, the corresponding HSKK test needs to be done. And the test results
                will be released in combination together.

            <strong>3. Upload a photo: </strong>

            Upload a standard, 2-inch identification photo in a JPG format not larger than 100KB. Test takers who
            register and choose to take the test at the test centers in mainland China are required to submit an
            electronic photo. If no photo has been uploaded or the uploaded one does not meet the requirements, test

            certificate. <br> <br>

            *If online registration is not available at the selected test center, you can go to the test center to
